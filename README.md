# Let's make building easier
tessera was built with the limitations of Minecraft in mind, If felt extremely limiting to only build one block at a time, so I decided to fix that.

Tessera comes with a variety of building tools to significantly speed up building. Use the boundary tools, copy/paste, repaint and many more to make building as easy as possible!

# Check out the Wiki!
Building a voxel game was a significant challenge and came with a host of new discoveries. I have written everything that I had to do to get to a complete voxel game like this one, Bear in mind the wiki is still a work in progress, however It contains a lot of information I would have really wanted to know when building my voxel game for the first time.

# Important notes
* The JVM version must be 17. If it is higher, the following message will show in output:
  * `[LWJGL] [ThreadLocalUtil] Unsupported JNI version detected, this may result in a crash. Please inform LWJGL developers.`
* I use LWJGL's Nuklear library that is builtin to LWJGL to do all of the UI rendering.
* Each chunk is 32x32x32 in size. Chunks coordinates are 3D
* The up direction is -Y, and the down direction is +Y
