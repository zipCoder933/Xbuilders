# Optimize XBuilders 2 or use Xbuilders 3?
In order to use Xbuilders 3, the following criteria must be met
* World flythrough stutter Isnt a problem
* There is An FPS problem but Im pretty sure its not related to the mesh rendering

Would it be faster to

   * XB3	fix the bugs in the world block setter
   * XB3	add block tools,
   * XB3	Add minecarts, vehicles, etc
   * migrate data to XB3

Or would it be faster to

   * XB2	Figure out how to fix JOGL Opengl errors
   * XB2	Fix any crashes, put mesh handling on main thread

# Todo list
1. FIX BLOCK PIPELINE BUGS FIRST!!!
   * **Play the game TO catch errors that appear**
   * Fix the listed bugs
4. Make a launcher that can launch XB2 or XB3
5. Fix any bugs that arise
