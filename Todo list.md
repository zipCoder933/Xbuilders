# Todo list
1. FIX BLOCK PIPELINE BUGS FIRST!!!
   2. Play the game and catch any errors that appear
   3. Fix the listed bugs
2. Implement occlusion culling
   3. FPS and chunk traveling performance is a general concern, however, it is a lot better than xbuilders 2, so I think i should just leave this issue alone
4. Make a launcher that can launch XB2 or XB3
5. Fix any bugs that arise
