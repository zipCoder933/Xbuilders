# Todo list
1. FIX BLOCK PIPELINE BUGS FIRST!!!
   * **Play the game TO catch errors that appear**
   * Fix the listed bugs
2. Implement occlusion culling
   * FPS and chunk traveling performance is a general concern, however, it is a lot better than xbuilders 2, so I think i should just leave this issue alone
4. Make a launcher that can launch XB2 or XB3
5. Fix any bugs that arise
