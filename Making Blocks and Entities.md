Use the "blocks and entities.blend" file to add new entities or blocks

# Making Entities
When importing the entity from blockbench, the model must be scaled **1.6x in all directions**

## Operator Preset when exporting OBJ

| Forward dir        | -Z    |
| Up dir             | -Y    |

# Making Blocks
Align the block with the square bounding box in blender
