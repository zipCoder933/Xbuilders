     * ABOUT THE INITIAL CAPACITY OF THE PRIORITY_BLOCKING_QUEUE
     * Setting the initial capacity of the PriorityBlockingQueue to the value of the ThreadPoolExecutor's maximumPoolSize
     * can be a reasonable approach, especially if you expect the number of tasks in the queue to be close to the
     * maximum number of tasks that the ThreadPoolExecutor will be executing concurrently. However, keep in mind that
     * the initial capacity is just a hint to the implementation and the queue will still dynamically resize if needed.
     * It's important to monitor the behavior of the application and adjust the initial capacity as needed based on
     * actual usage patterns.
